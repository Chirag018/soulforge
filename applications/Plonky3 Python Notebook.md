## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:

  

-  **Brief Description:**

With the success of the SP1 project, the Plonky3 proof system has garnered increasing attention. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive educational resources on Plonky3. Therefore, our goal is to develop an educational product centered on Plonky3 to fill this gap.

Our project aims to create an educational resource focusing on the technical principles of the Plonky3 proof system. We plan to present these concepts in an interactive manner through Python Notebooks, explaining the core ideas behind Plonky3 and providing code examples to help learners understand the principles behind each component of the Plonky3 project.

We are passionate about this project because it makes cutting-edge ZK technology more accessible to the public and provides the developer community with an easy-to-learn, step-by-step educational tool. Through this project, we hope to enable more developers to master Plonky3 and make it a significant driving force for the adoption and expansion of ZK technology.



  

-  **Core Idea:**

Describe the primary goal or innovation of your project. What’s the key component or architecture? Be concise yet detailed enough to showcase the essence of the idea.




-  **Technology Stack:**

We will use python notebook as the tool to conduct the writeups including the notes and code. Python notebook is widely used in explanatory materials, it's very reader friendly because it combines text and code together, so readers are easier to get good experience.

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

  

-  **Similar Projects:**

Currently, there are no comprehensive projects that systematically explain the underlying principles of Plonky3 components in the form of Python Notebooks.


-  **Unique Contribution:**

Our project fills the gap in educational resources for Plonky3 by offering developers the opportunity to learn Plonky3 in-depth through interactive Python Notebooks. Our product combines theory with practice, using code examples to help learners intuitively understand the technical principles of Plonky3, accelerating their mastery of Plonky3 and promoting the growth of the ZK ecosystem, especially in developer education and technology dissemination.

-  **Prior Work/Research (Optional):**

We have previously conducted courses on [PLONK and FRI & STARKs](https://github.com/Antalpha-Labs/zkp-academy/tree/main/FRI%26Stark) , along with a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbQFt1T_44Dywo9gGEpFGgtibk5zssprd) to further support the community.

To make learning easier, we implemented PLONK using Python and developed courses on PLONK. And recorded sessions available here：[Youtube list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbQFt1T_44Dy2FQU5oSbIdtfw2S64L72y)
