## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

- **Similar Projects:**

1. xceed365

- **Our Uniqueness**

BluuManagement's uniquiness over this dapp is majorly because we are making an all in one platform from human resource to task management, meetings i.e video / audio. This makes our dapp a better fit for most users since you can do all you want on one app rather than switching dapps to carry out a task.

- **Unique Contribution:**

BluuManagement would offer significant real-world validation for Plonky3 or Circom’s ZKP and zk-rollup capabilities, showcasing them as viable tools for complex, privacy-sensitive, and high-volume applications beyond blockchain-specific tasks. This mutual value exchange can push forward the adoption of zero-knowledge technology in new sectors like HR.

## [Section 5] Development Roadmap :open_book:

> **Important:** The maximum project duration is 2 months. Outline milestones and timelines accordingly.

### Milestone 1 — Basic Functionality

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month.

- **Description:**

  This milestone focuses on the full integration of the backend with the deployed smart contract, ensuring seamless interaction with the frontend interface. The backend will be responsible for managing communication between the smart contract and the application’s user interface, handling functions like data retrieval, updates, and transactions. Once the integration is complete, **Beta 1 Testing** will commence to verify the functionality, identify bugs, and ensure the system operates as intended in a real-world environment. This includes testing core features such as user interactions with the contract, task execution, and data consistency across the platform.

- **FTE (Full-Time Equivalent):**
  We have 3 team members with 2.4 FTE each.

- **Costs:**

  - Formal Proofs: 1000
  - CAC and business Reg - 300
  - Development (Circom + test): 4000

### Milestone 2 — Additional Features

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month

- **Description:**

Final project test and major deployments, then if we need to implement payroll management we mignt need to go for a high level audit.

- **FTE:** 2

- **Costs:** 4700

### Total Costs: 5,300+ 4,700 = 10,000 USDC

## [Section 6] Extended Scope

- \*\*Future Plan.
  We might need to feature some salary streaming platforms to make the management system a standalone dapp, this makes it easier to not only manage your workers but also ensures that payment is made without stress and also in the management app. This reduces the stress of switching between platforms and makes life a wholw lot easier.
